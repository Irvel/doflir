# Doflir
## Purpose
Doflir is a programming language that allows users to quickly analyze and manipulate data. It specializes in the area of text processing, where it facilitates common cleaning and preprocessing operations on text. This allows developers to prototype and iterate with ease when exploring a new dataset.

## Objective
Doflir aims to remove development friction when performing common data processing techniques on vectors, where traditional imperative languages such as C++ or Python require the developer to painstakingly specify how to carry out a procedure. Doflir allows the user to focus on the data itself and not on the process of handling such data. This enhances developer productivity, as the need to switch from the context of “what do I want to get from this dataset” to “how do I get what I want from this dataset” is minimized.

## Getting Started

To compile and run a Doflir program, you just need to run:
```
python DoflirCompiler.py doflir_programs/fibonacci.dof
python DoflirVirtualMachine.py doflir_programs/fibonacci.obj
```
